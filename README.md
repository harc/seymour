Seymour is a live programming environment that visualizes program execution as the user types. It features a micro visualization that shows details of the programâ€™s execution, and a macro visualization that puts the micro visualization in context, letting the user focus on different parts of the program execution. These visualizations come together to give the user a helpful live programming experience.

We are excited about the prospect of using this environment in the classroom and learning from student feedback. In doing so, we hope to make Seymour a valuable learning aid for students, and ultimately, create a better user experience for all programmers.
